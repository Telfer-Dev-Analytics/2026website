# Logo assets

Place your BTA logo files here so the site can use them:

- **logo-dark.png** — AI node + "bta" on dark/black background (used in header, hero, footer)
- **logo-light.png** — AI node + "bta" on light background (optional, for light sections)
- **favicon.png** — Purple square with white AI node (browser tab icon)

If you shared these in Cursor, copy them from your Cursor assets folder into this `assets` folder with the names above.
